# C# Console Challenges

This repository contains a collection of C# console challenges, organized by difficulty level.

## ðŸ“Œ About
The goal of this repository is to practice and improve C# skills step by step, starting from the basics and gradually moving toward advanced concepts â€” always coding directly in the console.

Some very basic challenges were skipped to focus on the most relevant and practical exercises.

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- Basic programming fundamentals (variables, input/output, operators, conditions, loops).
- Intermediate challenges (arrays, lists, dictionaries, methods, algorithms).
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstraction).
- Advanced topics (LINQ, file handling, JSON, exception handling, multithreading).
- Mini projects and console-based games.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build programming logic, strengthen knowledge in C# .NET, and have fun completing challenges of increasing difficulty.
